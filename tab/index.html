            Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space, much like an accordion.

Tabs have a particular set of markup that must be used in order for them to work properly:

The tabs themselves must be in either an ordered () or unordered list
Each tab "title" must be inside of a list item (and wrapped by an anchor th an href attribute
Each tab panel may be any valid element but it must have an id which corresponds to the hash in the anchor of the associated tab.
The content for each tab panel can be defined in-page or can be loaded via Ajax; both are handled automatically based on the href of the anchor associated with the tab. By default tabs are activated on click, but the events can be changed to hover via the event option.

Below is some sample markup:

Theming
The tabs widget uses the jQuery UI CSS framework to style its look and feel. If tabs specific styling is needed, the following CSS class names can be used for overrides or as keys for the classes option:

ui-tabs: The outer container of the tabs. This element will additionally have a class of ui-tabs-collapsible when the collapsible option is set.
ui-tabs-nav: The list of tabs.
ui-tabs-tab: One of the items in the list of tabs.The active item will have the ui-tabs-active class. Any list item whose associated content is loading via an Ajax call will have the ui-tabs-loading class.
ui-tabs-anchor: The anchors used to switch panels.
ui-tabs-panel: The panels associated with the tabs. Only the panel whose corresponding tab is active will be visible.
